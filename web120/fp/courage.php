<p>Sometimes, you just don't know where life will lead you...but the only thing you can do is--</p>

<p>to be brave, courageous and faithful to yourself. That’s the reason why I always use these colorful elements to cheer people</p>

<p>up, not only for myself. Remember, there’s always someone there for you.
