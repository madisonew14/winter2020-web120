    <p>In today’s world of technology, mobile applications are extremely prominent. Mobile apps make reaching information easily accessible while on the move, and for many people, apps are used more often than websites. When comparing the two mediums, mobile applications are faster, can be personalized to each user, and can interact with users through instant push notifications and updates.</p>

	<p>Mobile apps function with more speed than websites. According to VWO, apps are much faster because they are able to store data locally on the user’s device, whereas with websites, data needs to be reached through many different servers to be brought to the screen (2020). In addition, since the data is stored locally, users don’t always need to connect to the internet to use mobile applications. Fliplet gives a real life example on how not needing internet access for apps is more useful, “For example, loading updated content onto your app then going offline to read it can be an incredibly time-saving feature of mobile apps, particularly for people commuting to and from work via underground trains” (2020)</p>

	<p>Along with speed and accessibility, mobile apps can be personally tailored to their users. “This is made possible by drawing data on users’ interests, habits, location, usage patterns, etc. Along similar lines, apps are capable of tracking and analyzing user behavior, which is the key to supplying users with custom updates and recommendations” (Digital Agency Network 2019). An example of app personalization is Instagram’s Explore page, where the app curates content based on your browsing history and who you interact with.</p>

	<p>Apps can directly interact with users through push notifications and instant updates. This is incredibly useful for e-commerce, because it allows companies to directly communicate with customers. Retail apps can even send notifications to users about items left in their cart in hopes to get them to buy products. “As long as they have your business app installed on their device, you can effortlessly send them notifications and instant updates on latest offers, discount or maybe a business event in their locality” (Magneto 2018)</p>
