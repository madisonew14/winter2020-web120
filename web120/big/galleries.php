    <p>JQuery sliders are galleries that can be added to a website to allow users to view multiple images or other types of content in one rotating gallery. “Sliders—also known as "carousels" or "image sliders"—are interactive elements for showing images or other media in a web page” (Dye 2018) Before the use of jQuery sliders, having multiple images on one page took up a lot of room, and was cumbersome for users to have to scroll up and down a page to view several images. “Besides, considering how much of the human senses depend on sight, they present the opportunity to display more than one image at once. This is an especially important concept when it comes to on-screen real estate. Instead of showing just one image, show a perfect balance of them to create a combination of great visuals” (Malhotra 2019). jQuery sliders also provide an interactive way of displaying images rather than fixed content on the webpage.  Many jQuery sliders are designed with transition effects between images and can be enlarged on screen for viewers. In addition to their clean aesthetics, jQuery sliders have the ability to be search engine optimized by allowing developers to add captions and alt texts to each image.</p> 

	<p>Some of the best jQuery sliders include the mixed content slider and the gallery style slider. The mixed content slider can display not only images, but also text. According to Ziegler, advantages include being able to display text, videos and images in the same slider, however a disadvantage is that it may require additional html knowledge (2010). A popular jQuery slider is the gallery slider, which is popular among photography websites. They allow users to scroll through thumbnails and click on them to enlarge them. Gallery sliders are useful when displaying many images is required.</p>

    <p>According to Zielger, a disadvantage is that gallery sliders can be larger than most galleries, however, it lets users browse quickly through the thumbnail and slider capabilities (2010).</p>
