<p>Similar to what the name implies, digital shopping carts are a way for online users to make purchases on a website. Shopping carts include features such as checkout pages, the ability to take user payment info/shipping info, and allow users to “gather” items they want to purchase before checking out (much like a shopping cart one would use at the store). According to Cannon, “An online shopping cart is software that provides the necessary features for customers to make a retail purchase from your website. Some shopping cart software is quite simplistic and only adds the bare essentials, like products and a checkout page” (2019).</p>

<p>According to Wallace, “However, there are certain general demands for ecommerce platforms and experiences. These include product reviews (78%), customer reviews (69%), and side-by-side product comparisons (46%)” (2019). To create an ecommerce site with the best user experience, it’s ideal to use a shopping cart software that has these capabilities.  Some other good qualities to look for in a shopping cart software are ones that provide a short check out process, have the shopping cart in an easy-to-see area on the web page, don’t require users to sign up to buy, and simplifies for the form filling process (Ecommerce Nation 2019). According to Johnson, the 2019 top used shopping cart softwares were Shopify, 3dCart, Ecwid, and Magneto Open Source (2019).</p>

<p>More things to consider when choosing a shopping cart software are if there are features that will entice users to buy. For example, showing users when an item is almost out of stock, or giving a time limit on how long an item can be saved in a car on certain items. Some other nice capabilities include showing offers in the check out page like free shipping, and the ability to let users save items on a wish list (Koladyzn 2017).</p>
