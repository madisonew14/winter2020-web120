        <td><strong>Audience #1: Clients</strong><br>
            Clients age can range anywhere from young adults (18) to as old as 75 or potentially older. They are the biggest audience and the most significant for my client and the website will be built heavily around this audience. Clients are likely to be viewing my clients page on either a desktop viewport, mobile or tablet. My client’s website should be designed for easy use as some clients may not be experienced in navigating websites. Client’s potentially own their own businesses and would hire my client for her artwork. Lastly, a contact form would be an important element in my client’s website. Depending on the client, internet connection could be limited.

                <li>Clients may want to know about pricing</li>
                <li>Since clients may be viewing the website on any viewport they will want to view this website in a responsive way depending on what device they are using</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Include a contact form page but on the same page include external links to social media accounts</li>
                <li>Choose a media slider that will greatly enlarge images when clicked</li>
                <li>So clients can view past work of my client, we can potentially use a large image slider to showcase the work without slowing down the website and taking up too much room on the page</li>
                <li>Include an easy to see navigation in the top center of the web page</li>
                <li>Include media queries to be viewed on any device</li>

     <tr>
        <td><strong>Audience #2: Employers</strong><br>
            Potential employers age range between early twenties to late 50s. They could be hiring managers at a company or HR recruiters that will be looking at my client’s website if she considers applying to work for companies. Employers will most likely be viewing the website in their office on desktops or laptop viewports. They will less likely be viewing the website on mobile or tablet devices. Employers will probably be advanced at navigating the internet and have very good internet connection.

            Fellow designers can also have a large range between young adults to those over 50. They are most likely the most skilled in using the internet, but could be viewing the website on any viewport. They could be visiting my clients website and would want to network and/or connect through my clients social media accounts. Most designers will have access to strong internet connection.

                <li>Fellow designers will want an easy way to view my client's portfolio work</li>
