       <p>Hi everyone! Welcome to my portal website. My name is Madison and I'm pursuing my web design certificate. I'm currently a graphic designer that works mostly with print and illustration, and want to gain experience with interactive design. When I'm not working, I'm usually working out, traveling, trying out new foods, and cuddling with my cat Felix!</p>
